## 🧠 Heuristic-Fixable (Implemented)

| Rule | Description | mdmend Strategy | Status |
|------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| MD040 | Fenced code block has no language | Infer from: shebang line, content patterns, surrounding heading/filename context, file extension mentions. Configurable fallback (default: `text`). Always runs in `--suggest` mode unless `--aggressive` flag set. | ✅ Done |
| MD034 | Bare URL in text | Wrap in `<url>` angle brackets as safe default. Skip URLs inside code spans, code blocks, existing links. Configurable: `--url-style=angle` (default) or `--url-style=link` (converts to `[url](url)`). | ✅ Done |

**Progress: 2/2 (100%)**
